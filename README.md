### Answer the following question: 
**Question:** What is the total explained variance of the three principal components?

**Answer:** 89%

### Answer the following questions: 

* **Question:** What is the best value for `k` when using the PCA data?

  * **Answer:**  3


* **Question:** Does it differ from the best k value found using the original data?

  * **Answer:** Yes, 4 was the better for the original data.

## Visualize and Compare the Results

### Answer the following question: 

  * **Question:** After visually analyzing the cluster analysis results, what is the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data using K-Means?

  * **Answer:** Reducing the features changed the inertia. So PCA had better results for clusters compared to the scaled data. By using the optimal value of 2 from the PCA, we saw more precise clustering.
